## notebooks

`tess_cosmics.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the removal of TESS cosmic rays using Robust PCA. 

`test_video.mp4`: A video showing corrupted and uncorrupted simulated data side by side with the sparse and low rank components inferred with robust PCA. We see that the sparse component closely tracks the cosmic rays and the low rank component the uncorrupted image.
